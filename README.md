To reproduce the experimental process, this paper suggests following the following procedure:
1. Open the GitHub link, navigate to the “Data Collection” folder, and use the code for data collection.
2. Use two Google Colab links to conduct sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and coherence calculation.
3. Back to GitHub, open the “Determine Events” folder and calculate the sum of ranks for coherence and the number of documents.
4. Calculate the Sentiment Index for the selected topic, and determine event date
5. Use NRC to analyse the emotions of the selected topic
6. Finally, open the “Statistical Test” folder. For each date, compare the sample sizes before and after the date, conduct the S-W test on the samples before and after the date, and perform the Mann-Whitney U test.
